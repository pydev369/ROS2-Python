Table 2: ROS2 Majorly Used Concepts in Python for Basic Robotics

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Publisher | A node that publishes messages to a topic |
| Subscriber | A node that subscribes to messages on a topic |
| Service | A node that provides a service for other nodes to call |
| Client | A node that calls a service provided by another node |
| Parameter | A variable that can be modified at runtime |
| Action | A set of tasks that can be executed asynchronously |
| Timer | A mechanism for executing code at a specified interval |
| Transform | A representation of the position and orientation of an object in space |
| TF2 | A package for managing transforms in ROS2 |
| Launch file | A file that specifies how to launch a set of nodes and their parameters |

These concepts are fundamental to working with ROS2 in Python for basic robotics. Publishers and subscribers allow nodes to communicate with each other by sending and receiving messages on topics. Services and clients provide a way for nodes to request and provide services. Parameters allow for runtime configuration of nodes and packages. Actions provide a way to execute complex tasks asynchronously. Timers allow for executing code at specified intervals. Transforms and TF2 provide a way to represent the position and orientation of objects in space. Finally, launch files provide a convenient way to launch a set of nodes with their desired parameters.
